# SF Launcher 2

I no longer have the time to work on this project, so I'm releasing the source
here under the 3-clause BSD license.

This code is identical to the current version on the [Play Store][], except that it
now using the package `xyz.jathak.sflauncher`. This allows you to install a
development version based on this code alongside the released version.
